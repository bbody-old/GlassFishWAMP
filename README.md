# GlassFishWAMP
An example of using [WAMPee7](https://github.com/bbody/WAMPee7) for GlassFish 4.0, using source code from the [WAMPlay project](http://github.com/blopker/WAMPlay). Any contributions to GlassFishWAMP and WAMPee7 would be greatly appreciated!

## Test
Some basic Qunit test cases have been included, upon deploying the server if you goto [localhost:8080/GlassFishWAMP/test/](http://localhost:8080/GlassFishWAMP/test/) it will run them.
